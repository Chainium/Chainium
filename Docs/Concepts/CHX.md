# CHX


## What is CHX?

CHX is a utility token that powers [WeOwn](https://weown.com) blockchain and the products built on top of it:

- [Decentralized Share Register](https://dsr.weown.com)
- [Issuance Platform](https://fast.weown.com)
- The upcoming decentralized exchange

Primary purpose of the CHX is to:

- incentivize validators to run the nodes and keep the network decentralized
- protect the network from [DoS]() attacks
- serve as the transaction prioritization mechanism
