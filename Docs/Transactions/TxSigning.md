# Transaction Signing

Transactions must be cryptographically signed, using a private key of the sender address, before submitting them to the blockchain. A transaction for Own public blockchain can be signed in following ways:

- Using the SDK
- Using the wallet software


## Signing transactions using SDK

Please refer to the SDK docs for more information:

- [SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchainSdkJS)
- [SDK for .NET](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchain/tree/master/Source/Own.Blockchain.Public.Sdk)
- [SDK for JVM](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchainSdkJVM)
- [SDK for Go](https://github.com/OwnMarket/own-blockchain-sdk-go)
- [SDK for Python](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchainSdkPython)


## Signing transactions using the wallet software

When submitting transactions through the wallet software, signing is performed in the background using the imported private key.
For more information take a look at [our wallet](https://wallet.weown.com).
