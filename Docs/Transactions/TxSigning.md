# Transaction Signing

Transactions must be cryptographically signed, using a private key of the sender address, before submitting them to the blockchain. A transaction for Own public blockchain can be signed in following ways:

- Using the SDK
- Using the wallet software


## Signing transactions using SDK

Please refer to the SDK docs for more information:

- [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchainSdkJS)


## Signing transactions using the wallet software

When submitting transactions through the wallet software, signing is performed in the background using the imported private key.
For more information take a look at [our wallet](https://wallet.weown.com).
