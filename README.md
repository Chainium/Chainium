# OwnBlockchain

Own blockchain implementation


## Quick Start

- [Setup the development environment](Docs/Environment/SetupDevEnvironment.md).
- Go through the [documentation](Docs/README.md) to get familiar with the concepts,
    especially the [architecture](Docs/Architecture/Architecture.md) and [coding conventions](Docs/Codebase/CodingConventions.md).
- Clone the repository and build it:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchain.git OwnBlockchain
    $ cd OwnBlockchain/Source
    $ dotnet build
    ```


## Building on Own Blockchain

If you're interested in integrating Own blockchain into your system, please follow the [External System Integration](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchain/blob/master/Docs/Concepts/Integration.md) document.


## SDKs

Cryptography code needed to work with Own blockchain private/public keys, as well as to compose and sign transactions, is implemented for five major software development platforms:

- [SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchainSdkJS)
- [SDK for .NET](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchain/tree/master/Source/Own.Blockchain.Public.Sdk)
- [SDK for JVM](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchainSdkJVM)
- [SDK for Go](https://github.com/OwnMarket/own-blockchain-sdk-go)
- [SDK for Python](https://github.com/OwnMarket/OwnBlockchainSdkPython)
